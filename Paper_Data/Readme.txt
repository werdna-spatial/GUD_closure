Included here is the data.gud, gud_params.txt, and gud_traits.txt for the various versions of the model run for comparison and sensitivity analysis with regard to the paper:

Please see paper for greater detail and description.

There are 6 sets of runs with each set including 4 version conforming to the 2 treatments of foodweb (parallel, diamond) and zooplankton mortality/closure (linear, quadratic)

Directory codes used for treatments within set:
NP2Z1D      ->  2 phytoplankton and 1 zooplankton in Diamond  foodweb.  Quadratic closure.
NP2Z1D_lin  ->  2 phytoplankton and 1 zooplankton in Diamond  foodweb.  Linear closure.
NP2Z2D      ->  2 phytoplankton and 2 zooplankton in parallel foodweb.  Quadratic closure.
NP2Z2D_lin  ->  2 phytoplankton and 2 zooplankton in parallel foodweb.  Linear closure.

Directory path codes used for sets:

VD_base       - Primary model set used for closure comparison.
VD_incP  - Increased allometric size class for phytoplankton
VD_incZ  - Increased allometric size class for zooplankton
VD_incPZ - Increased allometric size class for phytoplankton and zooplankton
VD_Hol3       - Implementation of Hollings 3 on closure within model code.
VD_switch     - Density dependent prey switching with regard to grazing
