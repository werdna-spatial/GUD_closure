Included here is the gud_params.txt and gud_traits.txt for the various versions of the model run for comparison and sensitivity analysis with regard to the paper:

Please see paper for greater detail and description.

There are 6 sets of runs with each set including 4 version conforming to the 2 treatments of foodweb (parallel, doamond) and zooplankton mortality/closure (linear, quadratic)

Used codes for treatments:
NP2Z1D      ->  2 phytoplankton and 1 zooplankton in Diamond  foodweb.  Quadratic closure.
NP2Z1D_lin  ->  2 phytoplankton and 1 zooplankton in Diamond  foodweb.  Linear closure.
NP2Z2D      ->  2 phytoplankton and 2 zooplankton in parallel foodweb.  Quadratic closure.
NP2Z2D_lin  ->  2 phytoplankton and 2 zooplankton in parallel foodweb.  Linear closure.

Used codes for sets:

base       - Primary model set used for closure comparison.
logV_incP  - Increased allometric size class for phytoplankton
logV_incZ  - Increased allometric size class for zooplankton
logV_incZP - Increased allometric size class for phytoplankton and zooplankton
Hol3       - Implementation of Hollings 3 on closure within model code.
switch     - Density dependent prey switching with regard to grazing
